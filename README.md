# marcolussetti's dotfiles

Starting a new dotfiles repo from scratch, and keeping it very incremental.
Going to try to slowly build it up, and keep it manageable.

Context: switched again to Linux as my main off-work development environment.
Running Manjaro i3 edition which has defaults with remarkably good taste.

Last Linux environment (Antergos i3) had most of its dotfiles cloned from a
third party which did a really good job, but I never fully utilized their
power. Those are still around at https://github.com/marcolussetti/dotfiles-old
